Advancement :

- Moving average algorithm implemented on the rails.
- Right now, takes 10 neighbours for each block (5 before, 5 after) and mean the sum to compute the new height.
- Repeat it until the path is "continuous" (every neighbouring block is at the same level or has 1 height differencial).
- Right now, links only the blocks inside one straight line (there are 4 to circle the city center).

To-do :
- Test performance with other Average number (lower than 10 ? Higher than 10 ? Does it reduce the number of runs ?).
- Link all 4 straigth lines :
  - edges blocks (the ones that are less than 5 blocks away from another rail path) have to compute the smoothing algorithm with the next blocks on the other line, since at the moment it only considers the ones that are in the same line (so an average with less than 10 blocks, lower being 5, so there is no guarantee that the different paths are linked).
  - Be able to link any perpendicular line for future implementations (another rail network that are not circular, maybe a cross pattern from suburb areas to the city center).
